Welcome to my first grand programming experiment. Just trying to get the basic functionality working for now. 

I have succesfully gotten the graphics to display, but haven't figured out how to install the javascript. That is my next adventure.

Feel free to laugh or give advice. Both are welcomed (as long as you help me understand what is funny.)
